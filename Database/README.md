# Database Directory

This repository contains a directory for a database project. The purpose of this directory is to provide a centralized location for all files related to the database, including the database schema, stored procedures, and other database-related scripts.

## Files

This directory contains the following files:

- `schema.sql`: The database schema file that defines the structure of the database tables, columns, and relationships.

- `procedures.sql`: Stored procedures that can be used to manipulate the data in the database.

- `queries.sql`: Sample SQL queries that can be used to retrieve data from the database.

- `README.md`: This file, which provides an overview of the database directory and its contents.

## Usage

To use the database directory, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the `database` directory.

3. Import the `schema.sql` file into a MySQL database using the command `mysql -u [username] -p [database_name] < schema.sql`.

4. (Optional) Import the `procedures.sql` file using the same command to add stored procedures to the database.

5. Use the `queries.sql` file as a reference for writing SQL queries to retrieve data from the database.
